# PyDoku
PyDoku is a Sudoku Solver that I made
The way it works is it will check for 2 scenarios: only 1 number can go in a cell or only 1 cell can contain a number in a group
Because of the simplicity it doesnt' work for all sudoku puzzles, only easy level on sudokumood.com
You can copy paste 1 line of the puzzle at a time and move with arrow keys!
